 Streaming Audio
 
 Programmed by 
 Matthew Vaterlaus
 23 August 2010
 
 Adapted largely from Michael Smith's speaker_pcm.
 <michael@hurts.ca>
 
 Plays 8-bit PCM audio on pin 11 using pulse-width modulation.
 For Arduino with Atmega at 16 MHz.
 
 The audio data needs to be unsigned, 8-bit, 8000 Hz.
 
 Although Smith's speaker_pcm was very well programmed, it
 had two major limitations:  1. The size of program memory only
 allows ~5 seconds of audio at best.  2. To change the adudio,
 the microcontroller would need to be re-programmed with a new
 sounddata.h file.
 
 StreamingAudio overcomes these limitations by dynamically 
 sending audio samples to the Arduino via Serial.
 
 It uses a 1k circular buffer for the audio samples, since
 the ATMEGA328 only has 2k of RAM.  For chips with less RAM,
 the BUFFER_SIZE variable can be reduced.
 
 The only limit on length is the number of samples must fit
 into an long integer.  (ie:  4,294,967,295 samples).
 At 8000 samples / second, that allows 8,947 minutes of audio.
 Even this could be overcome if needed.  (The only reason to
 have the number of samples is to know when to turn the speaker
 off.)
 
 
 
 Remote Host
 -----------
 1.  Sends 10 bytes of data representing the number 
     of samples.  Each byte is 1 digit of an unsigned long.
 
 
 2.  Each time the host recieves a byte it sends the next
     128 audio samples to fill the Arduino's receive buffer.
